# üìà Stock Market Forecasting with LSTM

This project predicts future stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built with TensorFlow/Keras. A Streamlit web app is included to visualize the 7-day forecast for any uploaded stock CSV file.

# üöÄ Project Journey
## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Model Training

### 1. Data Loading
- Load `.csv` file (e.g., `MSFT_data.csv`)
- Format must include: `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`

### 2. Preprocessing
- Convert `date` column to `datetime`
- Focus on `close` prices
- Compute `SMA20` and `SMA50` for visualization

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plot close price over time
- Overlay SMA20/SMA50

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Extract `close` column
- Scale using `MinMaxScaler`
- Create sequences: 60 previous days to predict next 7 days

### 5. Model Building (LSTM)
- Use TensorFlow/Keras
- Input shape: `(60, 1)` ‚Üí Output: 7 future values

### 6. Model Training
- Train on historical sequences
- Evaluate using MSE/RMSE

### 7. Offline Prediction
- Use last 60 days to predict next 7 days
- Inverse transform predictions to original price scale

### 8. Plot Forecast vs Actual
- Plot actual prices and future forecast

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run from Scratch

### üîÅ Train Your Own Model
1. Open `notebooks/02_LSTM_Model.ipynb`
2. Replace the loaded CSV file with your own data (minimum 60 rows)
3. Run all cells
4. It will generate a model file inside `models/` directory (e.g., `lstm_msft_model.h5`)

### üß† Use Better Training
- Tweak model structure, epochs, or sequences in the notebook
- Re-train and re-save the model for better accuracy

## üìü How to Get Stock CSV Data

1. Visit [NSE India](https://www.nseindia.com)
2. Search for your desired stock (e.g., INFY, RELIANCE)
3. Go to **Historical Data** section
4. Set the date range to **at least 300 days**
5. Click **Download CSV**

Upload this CSV in the app to forecast the next 7 days.
